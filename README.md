 This program applies 8-node quadrilateral and 6-node triangular types of elements to solve 2-D steady state heat transfer problems using finite element methods.
 Object oriented programming concept is implemented. Mesh is generated by Abaqus. 
 
 Inputs: [filename.inp]
 
 To create an object (8-node quadrilateral type of elements):
 obj = AbaqusClassQ8(filename.inp)
 To find temperature distribution:
 obj.getT()
 To find flux distribution at quadrature points:
 obj.getFlux()
 
 Sample .inp files are provided. Each problem with different sets & types of boundary conditions needs complementary files, such as ProbXQ8Related.m.
 A main function is provided as an example to plot the temperature distribution and the flux distribution.
