# This program applies 8-node quadrilateral and 6-node triangular types of elements to solve 2-D steady state heat transfer problems using finite element methods.
# Object oriented programming concept is implemented. Mesh is generated by Abaqus. 
# Inputs: [filename.inp]
# To create an object (8-node quadrilateral type of elements):
#   obj = AbaqusClassQ8(filename.inp)
# To find temperature distribution:
#   obj.getT()
# To find flux distribution at quadrature points:
#   obj.getFlux()
# Sample .inp files are provided. Each problem with different sets & types of boundary conditions needs complementary files, such as ProbXQ8Related.m
# A main() function is provided as an example to plot the temperature distribution and the flux distribution.
